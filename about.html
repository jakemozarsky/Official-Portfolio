    About Me
</h1>

<p>
    I am from Westchester, New York and study sports journalism at Northwestern University. 

I am passionate about covering sports, whether the NHL, MLB, NFL, NBA or college. I have gained experience throughout my time at Northwestern in many areas.

I create both written and multimedia content, and I want to be a voice people can rely on in the sports industry while creating important stories!
