    <h1>  Juan Soto is destined for success with the New York Mets</h1>
<h2>
    2024 was Juan Soto’s best season yet. Here’s why he’ll have a better one in 2025 across town.
</h2>
           </div>

           <p>
            This offseason, the MLB world witnessed one of the biggest moves in sports history when Juan Soto signed a 15-year, $765 million contract with the New York Mets. Soto, who spent 2024 with the New York Yankees and put up career numbers, shocked many by taking his talents across town to Queens.
           </p>

           <p>
            At 26, Soto is viewed as one of the best players in the MLB and a generational talent. In 2024, he was a catalyst behind the Yankees’ World Series run — where they lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games — and provided many memorable moments on the way.
           </p>

           <p>
            Now, he’s in a different color, and the Mets were the best location for him to begin with. Here’s a few reasons why.
           </p>

    <h3>
        1. Soto's stellar 2024
    </h3>

    <p>
        In 2024 with the Yankees, Soto had the best year of his career dating back to 2019, when he won the World Series with the Washington Nationals. While the Yankees did not win it all, Soto is a major reason it had the success it did.
    </p>

    <p>
        As seen below, in his one year with the Yankees, Soto had a career-high 41 home runs and was one short of tying his career-high in RBI. This puts him 4th and 6th in the MLB, respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of Soto’s best attributes is his plate discipline, and he did not disappoint in 2024. His slugging percentage and on base percentage was both top five in baseball, putting him up there with Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani. If he is able to match his 2024 numbers, he'll make an immediate impact on the Mets.
